## Introduction

People like to drink alcohol for pleasure -- and there is nothing wrong with that. But if you drink alcohol in high amounts, this does not only endanger your health but instead can also lead to violent behaviour, as many scientific studies have shown.

Consuming high amounts of alcohol is predominantly a problem for youger people, as the following diagram makes clear. It shows the number of people, split into age groups, who got hospitalized while they were drunk:

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5} 
# Bar diagram: F10.0 cases per 1000 per age group in DE-DE
PL1 <- TOTAL %>% filter(GENDER == "all", AGE!="all", STATE=="DE-DE")
ggplot(data=PL1, aes(x=AGE, y=F100_p1000)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill = "#1E90FF") +
  xlab("Age Group") +
  ylab("F10.0 cases per 1000 people") +
  ggtitle("Hospitalization due to excessive alcohol consumption") +
  theme_bw() +           
  guides(fill=FALSE) +
  theme(text  = element_text(colour = "#797979"),
        axis.text.x  = element_text(angle=90, vjust=0.5),
        axis.title.y=element_text(margin=margin(10,10,0,10)))
```

But drinking alcohol does not only have short-term implications like being drunk and hurting yourself or somebody else. Drinking alcohol regularly and in high amounts for example also hurts your liver. Such consequences can only be seen in the long term, as the following graph indicates. It shows the number and age of people who got hospitalized with alcohol-related liver disease:

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5} 
# Bar diagram: K70 cases per 1000 per age group
ggplot(data=PL1, aes(x = AGE, y = K70_p1000, fill = AGE)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill = "#1E90FF") +
  xlab("Age Group") +
  ylab("K70 cases per 1000 people") +
  ggtitle("Alcohol-related liver problems") +
  guides(fill=FALSE) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(text  = element_text(colour = "#797979"),
        axis.text.x  = element_text(angle=90, vjust=0.5),
        axis.title.y=element_text(margin=margin(10,10,0,10)))
```

## Binge Drinking amongst youngsters -- an increasing problem

In Germany, drinking excesses have increasingly become a problem. 
The following maps compare the relative numbers of excessive alcohol consumption in the years 2000 and 2014:

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=5, out.width=c('350px', '350px')} 
spplot(map.Germany.2000.F100_p1000, 
       zcol = "value", 
       col.regions = colors,
       main=list(label="2000: F10.0 diagnoses\nper 1000 pp all age groups"),
       at = seq(0, 2.2, by = 0.1))
spplot(map.Germany.2014.F100_p1000, 
       zcol = "value", 
       col.regions = colors,
       main=list(label="2014: F10.0 diagnoses\nper 1000 pp all age groups"),
       at = seq(0, 2.2, by = 0.1),
       colorkey=FALSE)
```

## Policy Response

Politicians have reacted to the challenge, and the German state of Baden-Wuerttemberg was the first one to introduce a night sales ban on alcoholic beverages in 2010. But has it worked? The following graph gives an overview of all German states from 2000 to 2014. Baden-Wuerttemberg is marked in red, and the three German city states (Bremen, Berlin, and Hamburg) are marked in blue, as their levels of alcohol intoxications have remained comparably low over time.

## Has the ban worked?

The question for our research was: Has the ban worked? 
In our paper, which is accessible in extenso [here](https://github.com/torbatschow/CSSR_Project/blob/master/CSSR-Project.pdf), we were able to show that for young people it has, indeed. We conducted a statistical simulation which showed that the current numbers of alcohol intoxications are around 20 percent lower than they would be if the ban had not been introduced:

```{r echo = FALSE} 
plot_ly(bancomparison, x = ~YEAR, y = ~WBAN, type = 'bar', name = 'With Ban') %>%
  add_trace(y = ~WOBAN, name = 'Without Ban') %>%
  layout(xaxis = list(title = 'Year', titlefont = list(size = 18)), 
         yaxis = list(title = 'F10.0 Cases for 15 to 19 year-olds in DE-BW',
                      titlefont = list(size = 18)),
         legend = list(x = 0.8, y = 1, font = list(size = 18)),
         barmode = 'group')
```
