# Introduction

[//]: # (What, Why, How, Basic question, Basic answer)

In Western Europe alcohol is a commonly used drug for exhilaration. However, the fact that it is also known to be a, if not _the_ most harmful drug [@Nutt.2010], be it by direct or indirect consequences, make it a public policy issue. Especially young people are prone to the extensive (miss-) misuse ?????????????????? In this paper we want to investigate the impact of alcohol regulation on health and crime levels for young people. We will focus on Germany and a small subfield of alcohol policy: The ban of alcohol night sales and drinking in public. The two cases we are going to examine are [1] the 2010 introduced ban on alcohol night sales in the state of Baden-Wuerttenberg and [2] the prohibition of alcohol consumption in public in the state of Berlin from 1999 to 2006. We will examine these measures for their effects on hospital health records and on criminal offensives. For this research we utilize health data on diagnosis in hospitals and the criminal statistics from 2000 to 2014. Our empirical strategy relies on the difference in difference approach where other regions of Germany will be used as control group.

Our research proposal is inspired by the work of @Marcus.2015. We will try to replicate their work, but due to open data availablity in ledd depth.

Their research found a decrease in ... percent for ..., but did not find any significant effect on ...
