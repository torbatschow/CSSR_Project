# Introduction

K70 - Alkoholische Leberkrankheit

-->

In Western Europe alcohol is a commonly used medium for exhilaration. However, it is also known as a (if not *the most harmful*) drug [@Nutt.2010], be it because of its toxic nature itself or the indirect consequences: The consumption of alcoholic beverages may on the one hand lead to behavioural changes and violent acts, as has been indicated by numerous studies [see e.g. @Parker.1993; @Nielsen.2003; @Stolle.2009; @Sonderlund.2014]. On the other hand alcohol, if consumend regularly and over a longer period of time, does severe damage to individuals' health. It is therefore a policy concern not only to identify reasons and motivation for excessive alcohol consumption but also to develop measures to tackle this problem.

It is the aim of this paper to analyse both mentioned dimensions of the *challenge alcohol*. Using the example of all German federal states and time series data for different age groups from 2000 to 2014, we will [1] analyse the possible connection between medical diagnoses of alcohol misuse and possibly explanatory socioeconomic factors like gender, age, unemployment rate, education level, and regional economic performance. For this, we will take both short-term and long-term medical consequences of alcohol misuse into account by examining hospital health records on acute alcohol intoxication as well as on alcoholic liver disease. Besides the socio-economic factors mentioned above, we will [2] test the effect of recent policy measures on the German state level on alcohol consumption. The two cases we are going to examine are [a] the ban on alcohol night sales introduced in 2010 in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg and [b] the prohibition of alcohol consumption in vehicles and stations of public transport in the federal city state of Hamburg, introduced in 2011.

With this approach, we aim to present an analysis that offers insights into both possible causes for alcohol misuse as well as the efficiency of policy measures designed to counter excessive drinking.

In this paper we want to investigate the impact of two types of alcohol regulation on health and crime levels. We will focus on Germany and a small subfield of alcohol policy: The ban of alcohol night sales and drinking in public transport. The two cases we are going to examine are [1] the ban on alcohol night sales introduced in 2010 in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg and [2] the prohibition of alcohol consumption in vehicles and stations of public transport in the city of Hamburg, introduced in 2011. We will examine these measures for their effects on [a] hospital records of admissions under the influence of alcohol and [b] on cases of reported violent crime.

Our research proposal is inspired by the work of @Marcus.2015 who analysed *"The Effect of a Ban on Late-Night Off-premise Alcohol Sales on Alcohol-Related Hospital Stays in Germany"*. They find that the introduction of the alcohol night sales ban reduces alcohol-related hospitalizations among adolescents and young adults by about seven percent. In our analysis, we will not only try to replicate their work with the publicly available data sets. We are also going to build upon it -- by differenciate between short-term and longer-term effects. The focus on socio-economic explanatory factors like economic performance for the alcohol abuse as such is based upon research done by e.g. @Popovici.2013 and @Ettner.1997. Focusing on the United States, the two studies found inconsistent results: While one sees "a positive and significant effect of unemployment on drinking behaviors and the findings are robust to numerous sensitivity tests" [@Popovici.2013] the other argues that "non-employment significantly reduces both alcohol consumption and dependence symptoms, probably due to an income effect." [@Ettner.1997] For the German case, @Henkel.2000 finds a negative correlation between economic situation and alcohol and nicotine consumption.

Our research health data origins from the German [hospital diagnosis statistics](https://www.destatis.de/DE/Publikationen/Thematisch/Gesundheit/Krankenhaeuser/DiagnosedatenKrankenhaus.html) from 2000 to 2014, obtained via the [The Information System of the Federal Health Monitoring (GBE)](http://www.gbe-bund.de/). The data is reported by hospitals to the state statistical bureaus and then aggregated by the [Statitische Bundesamt Destatis](https://www.destatis.de/). The data contains the aggregated numbers of hospital diagnoses for each German state by age group, gender and year. The diagnoses are published according to the WHO International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10). 

The data is gathered via the online-interface of the [GBE](http://www.gbe-bund.de/). Unfortunately the data provider neigher provides and API nor a web-scrappable interface. Therefore we download the base tables manually by searching for the respective ICD-10 code, using the malleable tables to gather as much information in a single table as the data provider allows and export them.

The identify alcohol-related health problems we use the diagnose F10 (Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol), its subdivision F10.0 (Acute intoxication) and F10.2 (Dependence syndrome), and K70 (Alcoholic liver disease). The diagnoses category F10.0 covers cases of drunkness and the like. It essentially captures short term effects of excessive drinking, and can be used as an indicator for binge drinking.[^ICD] The categories F10.2 and K70 capture long-term effects of drinking.

The advantages of this data is that they reflect a complete survey of all civil hospitals in Germany for the time-frame of your investigation. Furthermore, the data is not self-reported by patients but gathered by a third party (the statistical bureau) there are no problems of self-reporting biases. For the case study of the Baden-Wuerttemberg night sale prohibition we do also benefit from the availability of a longer time series as  prior work on the issue (@Marcus.2015). Finally, the state-year aggregation level does allows us to supplement our analysis with a wide variety of other freely available data, e.g. the level of alcohol sales, unemployment rates etc. 

However, there are several serious limitations to the data we are using. First of all, the data set we are using can only be exploited with strong limitations with sophisticated methods like panel data analysis as we only have access to data which is reported annually and by state.[^FDZ] Hence, for the panel data analysis we can only use 14 years and 16 states, which makes a total of 224 data point for each combination of diagnoses, age group and gender. We still think it is meaning full to work with the data as we will also use simpler but still insightful methods like multiple linear regression and because our approach can be easily extended to more fine-grained data if it becomes available in the future. A second short coming is the lack of further patient information beyond their age and gender, e.g. socio-economic characteristics.

As already mentioned our analysis will be supplemented by data from other sources. We are in particular using indicators for the state level. They include the populations, the population density, unemployment rates of different age groups, the state gdp and beer sales by state. We are collecting this data from different statistics provided by *Destatis*.

#  Empirical strategy

We want to make a two stage analysis of short and long-term alcohol-related hospitalizations (ARH)[^ARH]. First, a multiple regression for a better understanding of factors correlated to high rates of hospital accessions. This analysis will show how characteristics of the state and the individual are correlated to the number ARH. The simple multiple regression model for one year t looks like this:
<!--
Question: Should we make the regression for one year, for the average of the whole period, or for each time-state pair?
Selecting one year has the advantage that the data will be purely cross-sectional and there are no time-effects.
If we make the regression on each time-state pair we have a much larger number of observations, but we might have time-effects which cause problems.
-->
\begin{equation}
    ARH_S = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \cdot GDP_S + \alpha_2 \cdot UR_S + \alpha_3 \cdot B_S + \alpha_4 \cdot PD_S + \epsilon
\end{equation}
Where GDP stands for the states GDP level, UR for the states unemployment rate, B for the beer consumption in the state and DP for the population density. The regression will be conducted for the aggregated number for all age groups and than for specific age-groups making use of the age-group specific unemployment rate.
Based on the idea that individuals adapt to their circumstances and are more reactive to changes than to actual levels we will analysis ARH difference:
\begin{equation}
   ARH_{S,T} = \alpha_0 \cdot ARH_{S,T-1} + \alpha_1 \cdot GDP_S + \alpha_2 \cdot UR_S + \alpha_3 \cdot B_S + \alpha_4 \cdot PD_S  + \epsilon_{S,T}
\end{equation}



To identify the effect of the night sales ban in Baden-Wuerttemberg we are using the Difference-in-Difference approach. Baden-Wuerttemberg is the treatment group, where as all other states are in the control group. The treatment begann in 2010, which is captured by the treatment dummy. Before spelling out the model, I will just make a few assumptions. We will look at specific age group, in particular young individuals. From @Marcus.2015 work we would expect to find a minor decrease of alcohol related hospitalizations for young individuals. The formal model looks like this:
\begin{equation}
   ARH_{S,T} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot BAN_{S,T} + \beta_2 \cdot POST_T + \beta_3 \cdot BW_S + \epsilon_{S,T}
\end{equation}
where BAN is a dummy variable for the night-sale-prohibition, post a dummy for the time after the treatment began and BW a dummy to indicate the treatment group. This model still works without controll variables, which we include in th next model:
<!--
WORK in PROGRESS
-->
\begin{equation}
  ARH_{S,T} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot BAN_{S,T} + X\beta_2 + c_S + \epsilon{S,T}
\end{equation}

The crime data is obtained from [criminal statistics published by the German Federal Criminal Police Office](https://www.bka.de/DE/AktuelleInformationen/StatistikenLagebilder/PolizeilicheKriminalstatistik/pks_node.html;jsessionid=5DFB83E1B040E5C0CCF7F9DF99203DA1.live0612) and covers the corresponding time period from 2004 to 2013. It captures the number of reported violent crimes under the influence of alcohol per German state and year.

Our empirical strategy relies on the difference in difference approach. For the Baden-Wuerttemberg case of night alcohol sale ban, other German states will be used as control group. In the Hamburg case of prohibited alcohol consumption in vehicles and stations of public transport, the state of Berlin will serve as a control group, as it is sensible to chose a city state of similar size and characteristics instead of a rural state.
