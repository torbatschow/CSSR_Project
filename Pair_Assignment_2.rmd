# Introduction

[//]: # (What, Why, How, Basic question, Basic answer)

In Western Europe alcohol is a commonly used drug for exhilaration. However, the fact that it is also known to be a, if not the most harmful drug [@Nutt.2010] make it a public policy issue. In this paper we want to investigate the impact of alcohol regulation on health and crime levels. We will focus on Germany and a small subfield of alcohol policy: Alcohol night sales and drinking in public prohibtion. We will track the impact of the 2010 introduced ban on alcohol night sales in the state of Baden-Wuerttenberg on hospital health records and on criminal offensives. For this research we utilize health data on diagnosis in hospitals and the criminal statistics from 2000 to 2014. Our empirical strategy relies on the difference in difference approach where other regions of Germany will be used as control group.

Our research proposal is inspired by the work of @Marcus.2015. We will try to replicate their work, but due to open data availablity in ledd depth. The estimated the short-term impact of the night alcohol sale ban in Baden-Wuerttenberg on binge drinking. Their research found a decrease in ... percent for ..., but did not find any significant effect on ...
