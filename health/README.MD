# Health Data

This is data downloaded from the [Statistische Bibliothek](https://www.destatis.de/GPStatistik/receive/DESerie_serie_00000950?list=all). The data is collected by the state bureaus for statistics (Landesstatistikamt) and aggregated by the Bundesstatistikamt DeStatis. The sheets contain the detailed diagnoses statistics from hospitals in Germany according to the ICD-10 classification. 

#cleaning the data

For our project we extract the alcohol related diagnoses (F10 and T51) and create an annual time series based on the state (and potentially age).
